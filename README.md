# Interpretator
My college project when I was 17 years old (3-rd course HCI NSU). The project implements a C-like language syntax that is interpreted and executed by the application.

## Perpose

The project was implemented as a course work for interpreters of programming languages or interpretation of user actions. Students were given the task to independently develop:
- Language (or set of actions) for interpretation (syntax, semantics)
- Data structures and algorithms for language parsing
- Data structures and algorithms for interpreting the language and displaying (output) the results of the application

## Results

As a defense of the course project, the student, together with the teacher, determined test cases sufficient to protect the work on the exam. The main test used to protect the project was selected algorithm for finding prime numbers.

## Code quality

The college subjects did not include code design courses, project management, testing, and other disciplines that study code quality. Therefore, the original version of the interpreter has a terrible code structure, despite the fact that test cases are executed correctly.

## Future Project Development
